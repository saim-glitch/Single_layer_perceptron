# Single Layer Perceptron

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a **Single Layer Perceptron** using `scikit-learn` for binary classification. The example uses a placement dataset containing features like CGPA and resume scores to predict whether a student is placed or not.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is `placement.csv`, containing the following features:
- `cgpa`: Student's CGPA
- `resume_score`: Resume score (0â€“10 scale)
- `placed`: Target label (1 = placed, 0 = not placed)
